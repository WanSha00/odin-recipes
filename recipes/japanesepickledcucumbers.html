        <h2>What is Japanese Pickled Cucumbers?</h2>
        <p><strong>Tsukemono</strong> (漬物) or <strong>Japanese pickles</strong> are an essential part of the Japanese diet. They are served typically with a meal, alongside rice and miso soup. 
            Pickles are used as a garnish, relish, or digestive food.</p>

        <p>It is also considered as a palate-cleansing side dish or we call Hashi Yasume (箸休め), literally meaning “chopstick rest” in Japanese.
            I recommend using Japanese cucumbers or Persian cucumbers to make this pickles recipe.

                Colman's English mustard which are made from a hot, yellow variety of mustard seed similar to Japanese mustard.)</li>

                Pickle for a few hours or up to 1-2 days in the refrigerator.</li>
